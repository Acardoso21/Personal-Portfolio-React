              I'm Andre Cardoso, a Computer Engineering student at Northeastern University with a strong foundation in software development and a proven ability to learn new technologies quickly. My technical skills include proficiency in Python, C++, and Java, and I've gained hands-on experience through technical consulting at <strong>Cisco</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my technical background, I've demonstrated leadership skills through my role as a <strong>stage manager</strong> in theater, which has honed my organizational and teamwork abilities. I'm fluent in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, allowing me to navigate diverse environments with ease.

              I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, and lived there for the first five years of my life. My family then relocated to New York City due to my fatherâ€™s job, where I grew up. After living in New York with my family, I moved to Boston to pursue my studies at Northeastern University. I'm currently taking a sabbatical from school to reflect and decide on my next challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm excited to explore new opportunities where I can leverage my technical skills and diverse experiences to make an impact.
